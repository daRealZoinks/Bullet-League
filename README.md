# Bullet League

First person shooter combined with soccer where you have to shoot the ball into the opponent team's goal. The game is multiplayer and can be played with up to 20 people in a single match (as long as the servers allow it). It has lots of fun mechanics such as 5 guns, a physics based movement system with momentum and gaining speed, and wallrunning.

The game is made in Unity and uses Photon Unity Network for networking. It's peer to peer, you can host a game and others can join it. It's client side authoritative, so the host has to trust the clients to not cheat and the ball is being simulated on the host, so the clients will have a bit of delay when the ball is moving. The game is made for fun and not for competitive play, soooooooooo, we can forgive the lag, right?

# Important
Because I'm an idiot, and I've deleted and .gitignore'd the meta files of the project when I uploaded it to github, when you'll open the project in unity you will get countless errors and missing references. All the code is still here and you can take a look at it though.
